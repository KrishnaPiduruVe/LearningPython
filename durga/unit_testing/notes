'''
There is no seperate team going forward for testing

Developer must be the tester in future

Testing :
    1. Unit Testing : 
        The process of testing each unit 
    2. Integration Testing : 
        end to end testing after integrating each unit
    
    Final testing is superior or final level testing

The process of testing whether a particular unit is working properly or not is called unit testing. --- Developer
The process of total application end to end is called integration testing --- QA

How to perform unit testing in Python:

inbuilt module name : unittest 
class name : TestCase
instance methods : 3 methods
                        1. setUp()
                        2. test()
                        3. tearDown()
class methods : 2 methods
                    1.setUpClass(cls)
                    2.tearDownClass(cls)

class TestCaseDemo(TestCase):


Lets say 10 test methods are there

setUp() --> 10 times
tearDown() ---> 10 times 
setUpClass(cls) ---> 1 time  
tearDownClass(cls) ---> 1 time
